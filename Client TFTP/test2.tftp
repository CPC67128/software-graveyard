NAME
     tftp - trivial file transfer program

SYNOPSIS
     tftp [ host ]

DESCRIPTION
     tftp is the user interface to  the  Internet  TFTP  (Trivial
     File  Transfer  Protocol),  which  allows  users to transfer
     files to and from a remote machine.  The remote host may  be
     specified  on the command line, in which case tfttp uses host
     as the default host for future transfers  (see  the  connnect
     command below).

USAGE
  Commands
     Once tftp is running, it issues the prompt tftp> and  recog-
     nizes the following commands:

     connect host-name [ port ]
           Set the host (and optionally port) for transfers.  The
           TFTP protocol, unlike the FTP protocol, does not main-
           tain connections between transfers; thus, the  connect
           command  does  not  actually  create a connection, but
           merely  remembers  what  host  is  to  be   used   for
           transfers.   You  do  not have to use the connect com-
           mand; the remote host can be specified as part of  the
           get or put commands.

     mode transfer-mode
           Set the mode for transfers; transfer-mode may  be  one
           of ascii or binary.  The default is ascii

     put filename
     put localfile remotefile
     put filename1 filename2 ... filenameN remote-directory
           Transfer a file, or a set of files, to  the  specified
           remote  file  or directory.  The destination
